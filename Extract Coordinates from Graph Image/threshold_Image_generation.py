# --- Example Usage ---
# You need to upload an image file to your Colab environment
# For demonstration, let's assume you have uploaded a file named 'graph.png'
# You can upload files using the file browser on the left sidebar in Colab.

# Replace 'graph.png' with the actual path to your graph image file
graph_image_path = '/content/g3.JPG' # Make sure this file exists in your Colab environment

# Run the conceptual function
extract_plot_data_from_image(graph_image_path)
